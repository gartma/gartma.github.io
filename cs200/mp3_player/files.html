<h5>MP3 Player</h5>
<p>A majority of this course dealt with an introduction to Java and priciples associated with the java language, like inheritance, and how that affects programming. The course was also designed to teach students on good design practices such as code-readability, documentation, avoiding repetiton, etc. The course also described forms of development methodology such as waterfall and DSDM. I've only included the final project in my portfolio as the rest of my assignments were geared toward learning the java language. This final assignment was to create a digital music player using java. The entire project started from scratch and needed to include a certain number of features, some of which were required. Due to the size of this project, the link below is directed towards my bitbucket repository where the project source code is stored.</p>
