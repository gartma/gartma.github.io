<h5>Midterm Mashup: API Intro</h5>
<p>This was a group project where me and another student were required to create a website of our choosing, using one of the hundreds of API's available on the web. This involved us thinking of a website to create, finding an API to use for that website, and learning about the API we were working with. We chose to make a website that takes all the information to create a google calendar event, and makes a QR code. When that QR code is scanned, the program will ask the user to allow the website access to their google calendar and email address. After the user authorizes, the program will add the event to their google calendar! The files are currently written to interact with the knuth.luther.edu server at Luther College.</p>
