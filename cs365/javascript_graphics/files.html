<h5>Javascript and Graphics</h5>
<p>This assignment was the first javascript assignment. I was supposed to create a interactive javascript graphics program. The assignment was focused on using the canvas element and doing javascript graphic commands. I created a simple doodleboard that is supposed to emulate what an etch-e-sketch does, but with two lines instead of one.</p>
