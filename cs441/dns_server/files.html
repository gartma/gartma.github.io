<h5>DNS Server</h5>
<p>A majority of this course was spent looking at concurrency and solving the issues associated with concurrency. As such, we took a quick peek at the java thread model. This project was an assignment to implement concepts discussed in class, as well as give us some practical experience with concurrency and java. The server is designed to accept clients on the port 9782. When the client enters a domain name, it will return the ip address assocaited with that name. This was the server I modified for my Java Server assignment in the Internet Programming Course.</p>
