<h5>Dekkers Algorithm</h5>
<p>This was a very short assignment. For a couple weeks we talked about Dekkers algorithm and how he got to the final algorithm he made (not Peterson's), before we started talking about semaphores. This was a quick assignment meant to demonstrate our understanding of Dekkers final algorithm and how it satisfies all the properties of the mutual exclusion problem. <u>The only important file is Dekker.java</u>, the rest are files used to create the scenario of multiple users attempted to withdraw money from a bank account.</p>
