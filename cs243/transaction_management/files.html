<h5>Transaction Management</h5>
<p>This short assignment was to test our understanding of what a transaction is and how it is handled. We were asked to create a transaction to insert a new record in the database. The new record must satisfy all database level requirements in order to commit, and so knowledge of entity relationships was required in order to correctly complete the program.</p>
