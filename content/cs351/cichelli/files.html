<h5>Cichelli's Perfect Hashing</h5>
<p>Throughout the course, short sections of hashing were discussed. Near the end of the course, hashing was talked about in much more detail. The final lecture resulted in an assignment to implement Cichelli's Perfect Hashing function. The skeleton of the file was provided by the professor, but the functionality of the program was completed by the student.</p>
