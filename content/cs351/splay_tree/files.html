<h5>Splay Tree</h5>
<p>After discussing the concepts behind a splay tree in class, the assignment was to implement insert, retrieve, and delete as well as a few helper functions for the splay tree data structure while still maintaining splay tree properties. The skeleton of the file was provided by the professor, but the functionality of the program was completed by the student.</p>
