<h5>SML Calculator</h5>
<p>Throughout the course, we programmed the same calculator program in different languages to see how each programming paradigm handled multiple aspects of programming such as inheritance, grammar, language implementation, type-checking, addressing and references, etc. A large skeleton of the assignment was presented so that the student wouldn't have to write a parser, scanner, etc. The student needed to create an abstract syntax tree from the expression that was parsed, reduce the abstract syntax tree, and handle input and output for the calculator. The only files that were modified are included here.</p>
