<h5>Web2py Server</h5>
<p>This group project was the final for Internet Programming. We took an indepth look at web2py, a web framework, programmed in python. Web2py follows a Model-View-Controller design, and is compatable with multiple query languages. For more information on web2py, visit the website, <a href="http://www.web2py.com">www.web2py.com</a>. For this assignment, I wanted to get started on a project that I've been wanted to implement for a while. This program is meant to assist in the table-top role-playing game called Exalted. The website kept track of player data, and would assist the user in activities involved with Exalted. Due to the size of the assignment, source files are in the bitbucket repository linked below.</p>
