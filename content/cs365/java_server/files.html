<h5>Java Server</h5>
<p>For this assignment, the class was asked to create a server. Prior to this we had been looking at multi-threading, multi-processing, and non-blocking I/O servers. The task was to design a server using one of these common implementations in python. I was taking the Operating Systems course at the same time, and we were studying concurrency with java. Instead of implementing the server in python, I decided to expand the code for an assignment in the Operating Systems course that was in java.</p>
