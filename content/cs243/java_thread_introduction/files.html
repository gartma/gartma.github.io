<h5>Java Thread Introduction</h5>
<p>In order to prepare for the Quiescent Checkpoint assignment, the professor introduced the class to the java thread model. Since this is a sophomore level class, students aren't expected to have taken the senior level Operating Systems course that covers concurrency in more detail. After a lecture on the java object lock and methods wait(), notify(), and notifyAll(), the class was asked to demonstrate their understanding by creating a program that created five threads that were waiting on another thread to release the lock on a 'synch' object.</p>
