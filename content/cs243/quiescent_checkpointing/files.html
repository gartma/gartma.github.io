<h5>Quiescent Checkpointing</h5>
<p>After exploring commit, rollback, and recovery for transactions, the class took a look at quiescent checkpointing. Using the java thread model, the program tracks when an array of transactions is empty and will begin a quiescent checkpoint. To test this, part of the assignment was to create two unit test files. The files presented here are the ones I modified and are part of a larger complete database system created by Edward Sciore. Throughout the class, we examined parts of this database and made modifications to improve its performance. The text we used was by Edward Sciore so the text accompanied Sciore's database.</p>
