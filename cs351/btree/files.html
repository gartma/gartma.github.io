<h5>BTree</h5>
<p>After discussing the concepts behind a BTree in class, the assignment was to implement insert, retrieve, and delete as well as a few helper functions for the BTree structure while still maintaining BTree properties. The skeleton of the file was provided by the professor, but the functionality of the program was completed by the student.</p>
